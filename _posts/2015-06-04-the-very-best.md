**[The Very Best](http://theverybestmusic.com "The Very Best")** is Malawi’s Esau Mwamwaya and London-based producer Johan Hugo (We Don’t Belong in Pacha). Their chance introduction over the purchase of a bicycle in 2008 led production duo Radioclit to invite Esau Mwamwaya into their studio to collaborate on the mixtape that would launch their career. Containing an infectious cross-pollination of samples and rhythms anchored by Esau’s soaring vocals, the mixtape quickly went viral.

**[Glass Lux](http://glasslux.net "Glass Lux")** formed in October 2010 when producer/DJ Alfonso Mayen met vocalist Emily Morse. The resulting project led to a slick dance-and-synth-heavy sound showcasing Le Fonz’s catchy production and Emily’s hauntingly mature voice.
