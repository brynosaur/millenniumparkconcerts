Shara Worden's voice and arresting live performances have left audiences thunderstruck from the Sydney Opera House to Lincoln Center to the House of Blues. A multi-instrumentalist and trained opera singer, she's performed under the experimental-pop moniker **My Brightest Diamond** for the last seven years, and has collaborated with The Decemberists' on their *The Hazards of Love*, Sufjan Stevens, David Byrne, Brooklyn Rider, Bryce and Aaron Dessner in The Long Count, and appeared recently in the work of Matthew Barney's opera, River of Fundament. Her new album is released in fall 2014.

Chicago brother / sister duo **White Mystery**, Miss Alex White & Francis Scott Key White, round out the bill with their bombastic rock attack.
