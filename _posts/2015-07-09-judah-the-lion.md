**[Judah & the Lion] (http://judahandthelion.com "Judah & the Lion")** (Judah Akers, Nate Zuercher and Brian Macdonald) is a modern pop band with a feel as old as hills and holler. They are the happy sum of disparate parts, Southern grit, Midwestern (Chicago) openness, the exuberant freedom of the West, all brought together to make a truly joyful noise. The band has released two successful EPs, First Fruits and Sweet Tennessee. The latter blasted onto the Billboard charts, hitting the Top 20 in a variety of genres, and “Sweet Tennessee” made it to #1 on the iTunes “Singer/Songwriter” chart.
