**Maps & Atlases** are a Chicago rock band who defy easy categorization. Their experimental and traditional song-forms collide with hymnal harmonies, percolating rhythms, and maximalist creativity, resulting in boundary-busting, asymmetrical pop.

**Wooden Shjips**, recording on Chicago's Thrill Jockey label, transform heavy psychedelic rock into minimalist masterpieces.
