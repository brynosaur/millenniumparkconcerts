The 39-year-old Texan **[Hayes Carll](http://hayescarll.com "Hayes Carll")** connects with music lovers across genres lines. Playing rock clubs and honky tonks, Bonnaroo, Stones Fest, SXSW and NXNE, he and his band the Gulf Coast Orchestra merge a truculent singer/songwriter take that combines Ray Wylie Hubband’s lean freewheeling squalor with Todd Snider’s brazen Gen Y reality.

**[Mother Falcon](http://motherfalcon.com "Mother Falcon")** began as a jam session among a few adventurous high school cellists. In the seven years since, violins, saxophones, trumpet, piano, accordion, banjo, guitars and bassoon have joined them in an indie orchestra of 20 classically-trained young musicians.
