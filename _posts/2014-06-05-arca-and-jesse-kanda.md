Venezuelan-born producer **Arca** and London-based director **Jesse Kanda** will present the Chicago premiere of *Trauma*. Known for his significant production credits on Kanye Westâ€™s *Yeezus* album, Arca will sound off sections of his latest work, *&&&&&*, while Kanda visually interprets the music through live modification of abstract video shapes and formations.

**Civitas Ensemble**, founded by members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2011, will open. Heralded by the *Chicago Tribune*, *Chicago Classical Review*, and *Chicago on the Aisle* for its quality of performances as well as its community engagement efforts, the musicians will perform Augusta Read Thomas' *Toft Serenade*, among other selections.
