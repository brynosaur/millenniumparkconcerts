**[Poi Dog Pondering](http://poidogpondering.com "Poi Dog Pondering")**, “the little big band with the strong back and supple, stubborn heart," has been following their intuition for over 25 years. From bohemian street buskers to impossible-to-market major label sacrificial lambs, the Chicago-based group has ripened into staunchly independent musical voyagers. The vinyl version of their latest album, *Everybody’s Got a Star*, will be available for the first time at Downtown Sound.

**[Caroline Smith](http://carolinesmithcarolinesmith.com "Caroline Smith")** earned her place in the Midwest music community with her characteristic alto timbre, quivering with the presence of Billie Holiday, Leslie Feist and Joanna Newsom. Smith’s new music merges ’90s R&B and neo-soul with her indie-rock roots.
