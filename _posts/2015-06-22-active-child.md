LA-based multi-instrumentalist Patrick Grossi, aka [Active Child](http://activechildmusic.com "Active Child"), will present the Chicago live premiere of his highly anticipated sophomore full-length album, *Mercy*. Known for his porcelain falsetto and cascading harp, Active Child’s live show shimmers with lush arrangements, stunning visuals and a talented team of backing musicians.

Chicago bassist-composer **[Matt Ulery](http://mattulery.com "Matt Ulery")** creates resplendent, lyrical, transportive chamber-jazz music. Ulery has forged a unique signature sound, with three-time Grammy-winning ensemble **eighth blackbird** plus a core rhythm team: UIlery, double bass and voice; Rob Clearfield, piano, Jon Deitemyer, drums; vocalist Grazyna Auguscik; Aurelien Pederzoli, violin; and Dominic Johnson, viola.
