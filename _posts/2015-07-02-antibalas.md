Born in a Brooklyn warehouse in 1997, 12-piece ensemble **[Antibalas](http://antibalas.com "Antibalas")** is credited with introducing Afrobeat to a wider global audience, influencing countless musicians and developing a live show that is the stuff of legend. On the heels of the hit musical FELA!, on which several members collaborated, Antibalas has reunited with former member and producer Gabe Roth.

The debut album from **[Sonny Knight and The Lakers](http://sonnyknight.com "Sonny Knight and The Lakers")**, *I’m Still Here*, was released in 2014. In person, Sonny Knight defies his 66 years of age. Nearly 50 years have passed since Knight’s first recording, but he says for the first time he feels like the center of attention.
