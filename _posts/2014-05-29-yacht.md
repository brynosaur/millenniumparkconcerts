LA-based conceptual pop group **YACHT** has played on boats, in caves, in bathrooms, and in art galleries, not to mention tours with LCD Soundsystem, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Hot Chip, Architecture in Helsinki, Vampire Weekend, The Dirty Projectors, the Breeders, and Phoenix. Their live set, named “Temporary Autonomous Zones”, features uncluttered, anarchic, inspiring sessions of damaged dance moves and coded ritualism, backed by constantly changing elements—Power Point presentations, audience Q&A sessions, and shamanistic video environments.

Prepared piano innovator Hauschka will open the show displaying his modern methods of creating unsuspected electronic sounding tones from the instrument. He will be supporting his latest album release *Abandoned City* and will be joined on stage by renowned local Chicago all-female string players, **Q Ensemble**.
