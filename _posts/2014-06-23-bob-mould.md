**Bob Mould**'s journey as singer-songwriter, guitarist, author, DJ, and all-around MVP began in 1979 with the formation of Hüsker Dü. In 1988, Mould began the first part of his solo career with the albums *Workbook* and *Black Sheets of Rain*. In 1992, Bob gave the world Sugar, a reimagined power trio. Now well into his fourth decade as a singer-songwriter, Mould is as relevant, ferocious, and poignant as he has ever. The new album *Beauty & Ruin* may very well be the most epic emotional roller coaster ever pressed into 36 minutes.

**Split Single** is the new project from Jason Narducy. Jason recorded the album, *Fragmented World* with Spoon's Britt Daniel, and Superchunk / Mountain Goats drummer Jon Wurster to craft a plush collection of rock songs. He will be performing these songs with Chicago musicians Tim Remis and Jake Smith.
