San Francisco-based artist **Christopher Willits** uses his self-designed software tools to “paint with his guitar” (Pitchfork), creating “mesmerizing, intricate electronic soundscapes” (Nowness) and lush audiovisual performances of weaving patterns, texture, and harmony. Working solo and in collaboration with the likes of Ryuichi Sakamoto, Matmos, Zach Hill (Hella/Death Grips), and Taylor Deupree, Willits will present a new sound and image performance improvised with inspiration drawn from Millennium Park itself.

**Civitas Ensemble**, founded by members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2011, will open. Heralded by the *Chicago Tribune*, *Chicago Classical Review*, and *Chicago on the Aisle* for its quality of performances as well as its community engagement efforts, the musicians will perform Augusta Read Thomas' *Toft Serenade*, among other selections.
