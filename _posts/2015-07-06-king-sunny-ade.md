**[King Sunny Ade](http://on.fb.me/1GB765u "King Sunny Ade")** is the undisputed king of juju music, the dance-inspiring hybrid of western pop and traditional African music with roots in the guitar tradition of Nigeria. Ade launched his own record label in 1974 and has released more than 100 of his own recordings in Nigeria. This tour marks his first visit to North America in 7 years.

**[Mathew Tembo's](http://mathewtembo.com "Mathew Tembo")** music fuses indigenous Zambian vibes with contemporary sounds to create a truly unique form. His latest album, Dadi Mwana, resounds in upbeat, Afro-fusion, reggae-fueled tracks featuring lyrics in various languages skillfully performed on handmade instruments.
