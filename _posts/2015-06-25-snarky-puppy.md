**[Snarky Puppy](http://snarkypuppy.ropeadope.com "Snarky Puppy")** seamlessly fuses a deep knowledge and respect for musical tradition with sonic and conceptual innovation. The New York-based quasi-collective has gone from the best-kept secret to one of the most respected names in instrumental music.

The internationally renowned percussion ensemble **[Third Coast Percussion](thirdcoastpercussion.com "Third Coast Percussion")** will lead an army of Chicago’s finest musicians in a performance of “In C” to celebrate the 80th birthday of composer Terry Riley – featuring members of Spektral Quartet, Ensemble Dal Niente, New Music Chicago and numerous educational institutions. Considered the first piece of “minimalism,” this landmark 1964 work changed the course of contemporary classical music. Formed in 2005, Third Coast Percussion has developed an international reputation with concerts and recordings of inspiring energy and subtle nuance.
