The entire Grammy-winning cast of **Eighth Blackbird** will take the stage with special guest Michael Ward-Bergeman. The Blackbirds have been called “a new breed of super-musicians” (*Los Angeles Times*) and “stage animals” (*The Sunday Telegraph*). Ward-Bergeman, a respected composer from New Orleans with commissions by Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Project and performances as a hyper-accordionist at diverse venues ranging from Carnegie Hall to Gainesville Correctional Facility, will join Eighth Blackbird for a program that zings, zooms and zips with verve and wit.

Included will be the rambunctious Murder Ballades by rock & roll band The National's, **Bryce Dessner**.
