Named by Rolling Stone Magazine as one of the Top 20 Guitarists of All Time, **Richard Thompson** is also one of the world's most critically acclaimed and prolific songwriters. Having co-founded the groundbreaking group Fairport Convention as a teenager in the 60's, Richard Thompson and his mates virtually invented British Folk Rock. By the age of 21 he left the band to pursue his own career, followed by a decade long musical partnership with his then-wife Linda, to over 30 years as a highly successful solo artist.

His last album *Electric*, was produced by studio extraordinaire Buddy Miller, and released by New West records in February of 2013. For his Millennium Park debut Mr. Thompson will play a solo acoustic set followed by a full electric set with his trio.
