Colombian musician Mario Galeano, the force behind the band Frente Cumbiero, and English producer Will Holland (aka Quantic) have joined forces to create the **[Ondatrópica](http://ondatropica.com "Ondatrópica")** project—supported by the British Council to explore and expand the tropical sound of Colombia in its rawest form, and to marry it with the cool sound of London.

A South Florida native, born to Ecuadorian immigrants and based in Brooklyn, Roberto Carlos Lange (aka [Helado Negro](http://heladonegro.squarespace.com "Helado Negro")) says his upbringing provides essential elements to his songwriting. Helado Negro presents a new shivers-down-the spine concert experience, with costuming and movement developed during his recent 42 city tour.
