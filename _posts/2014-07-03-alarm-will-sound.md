**Concert occurs on Wednesday July 3 due to Fourth of July holiday**

**Alarm Will Sound**'s Chicago debut features the music of Aphex Twin, Steve Reich, Tyondai Braxton and John Orfe. The large ensemble has been described as "the SEAL Team Six of new music" by *New York Magazine* and as "one of the most vital ensembles on the American music scene" by the *New York Times*. In this show, Alarm Will Sound transforms the electronica of Aphex Twin into live performance on acoustic instruments, putting machine-made music into the hands of human players. Steve Reich's newest work *Radio Rewrite*, based on the music of Radiohead, and Tyondai Braxton's *Fly By Wire*, both written specifically for Alarm Will Sound's adventurous virtuosos, explore the relationship between popular and classical music.
