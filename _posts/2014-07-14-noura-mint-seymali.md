**Noura Mint Seymali** is one of Mauritania's foremost musical emissaries and a nationally beloved star, having begun her career, aged 13, as a supporting vocalist with her legendary step-mother Dimi Mint Abba. Drawing on Mauritania's unique intersection of Arab and sub-Saharan African culture, Noura Mint Seymali pushes the dialectic of Mauritanian griot music forward into deep space.

**Heavyweight Dub** is the brainchild of Chicago drummer and bandleader Ted Sirota. In 2013 they recorded with Reggae Dub legend Scientist for their debut album.
