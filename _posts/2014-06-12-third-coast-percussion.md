Hailed by The New Yorker as “vibrant” and “superb,” Chicago-based **Third Coast Percussion** has gained national attention with concerts and recordings that meld the energy of rock music with the precision and nuance of classical chamber works. Currently the Ensemble-in-Residence at the University of Notre Dame, Third Coast Percussion will be performing a program of music all by acclaimed Chicago composers. *Resounding Earth*, by internationally-renowned composer Augusta Read Thomas, features over 300 bells and other ringing metal objects from around the world. The piece was recently hailed by the *Chicago Classical Review* as "one of the most powerful new music experiences I've felt in years." The program will also feature Marc Mellits's rapturous new work, *Gravity*, and works by TCP-member David Skidmore and former TCP-member Owen Clayton Condon.

Tropical grit pop band **Ghost Beach** opens, infecting listeners with contagious ear-candy offerings from their recent Nettwerk Records release, *Blonde*.
