Chicago's **Russian Circles** bring their soaring, triumphant instrumental metal to the Pritzker Pavilion, showcasing their 2013 release *Memorial*.

Opening is **Colin Stetson**, who spent the last two years playing saxophone with Bon Iver. Here he performs works from his 2013 solo album, *New History Warfare Volume 3: To See More Light*, using a stunning circular breathing technique and unprecedented approach to the instrument to create dense cascading layers of sound.
