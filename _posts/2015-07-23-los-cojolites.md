**[Los Cojolites](http://facebook.com/loscojolites "Los Cojolites")** was born in 1995 as part of a project dedicated to recover artistic expressions of indigenous people in the ancient town of Cosoleacaque, Veracruz, Mexico. In December 2014, they presented their fourth production, Zapateando, which includes traditional sones.

David Wax and Suz Slezak form the artistic core of the **[David Wax Museum](http://davidwaxmuseum.com "David Wax Museum")** and together fuse traditional Mexican folk with American roots and indie rock to create a Mexo-Americana aesthetic. They have built a reputation among concertgoers for “kicking up a cloud of excitement with their high-energy border-crossing sensibility” (The New Yorker).
