Collectively and individually, **Aimee Mann** and **Ted Leo** have more years of musical experience under their belts than most. You might call them "lifers." Over the years, they became friendly, leading to a tour together. Inspired by the folksy but edgy rock melodicism and spooky, soulful atmosphere of early Thin Lizzy songs, they began writing together, growing ever closer and more fulfilled working together until "The Both" (originally called #BOTH, because it made them laugh) was born.

Chicago's **Pillars & Tongues** craft cinematic art-rock that promises to blanket the Pritzker Pavilion in warm, lush soundscapes with haunting vocals.â€‹
