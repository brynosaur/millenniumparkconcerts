On the surface, **[Murder By Death](http://murderbydeath.com "Murder by Death")** is a Bloomington, Ind. quintet with a wry, ominous name. But behind the geography and moniker is a band of meticulous and literary songwriters matched by a specific brand of brooding, anthem-riding balladry and orchestral indie rock. Their latest release, *Big Dark Love*, is the band’s seventh full-length album.

Originally from Birmingham, Ala., **[Banditos](http://banditosband.com "Banditos")** is a group—more like a gang, actually—of six twentysomethings, operating out of Nashville. Their self-titled debut album bodaciously appropriates elements of ’60s blues-fused acid rock, ZZ Top’s jangly boogie, garage punk scuzz à la Burger Records and more.
