After spending the ’80s as an unappreciated jangle pop guitarist and solo artist with albums released on Columbia and A&M Records, **[Matthew Sweet](http://matthewsweet.com "Matthew Sweet")** emerged in 1991 as the leading figure of the American power pop revival. Sweet made his most recent record, Modern Art (2011), with Velvet Crush founder Ric Menck on drums and Dennis Taylor on guitar.

Erik Hall worked patiently and solitarily for four years to craft Driver, his sophomore album as **[In Tall Buildings](http://intallbuildings.com "In Tall Buildings")**, produced between his home studio in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood and a ’60s farmhouse in Leelanau County, Mich. His music is powerful in its restrained simplicity.
