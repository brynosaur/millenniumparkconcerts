Hailing from Syria, **Omar Souleyman** not only changed the vibe of weddings throughout the Middle East with his Shaabi street sound, but also brought it to the West through his notorious late night festival slots. His latest release, *Wenu Wenu*, was produced by Kieran Hebden (Four Tet).

**Natural Information Society** is the genre-defying project of Chicago bassist Joshua Abrams. In performance the music revolves around the sound of the guimbri (a Gnawan lute), integrating composition and improvisation to create hypnotic, highly rhythmic, sustained psychedelic environments.
