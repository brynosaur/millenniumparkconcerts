Acclaimed electronic music composer Daniel Lopatin, who records and performs under the moniker **Oneohtrix Point Never**, has always deftly balanced the experimental with the accessible. On his latest Warp Records release, *Commissions I*, the artist outlays his commissioned music for artwork, performance and film from years past. This music will be on full display when video artist **Nate Boyce** joins the lineup. Boyce, like Lopatin and his live soundscapes, creates improvised visuals and CGI forms, mutating and morphing found-text in disorientating virtual space. No strangers to the art museum circuit the duo have toured together extensively, performing at venues including MoMA/PS1, the Walker Art Center, and Wexner Center for the Arts.

Ensemble-in-residence at the University of Chicago, **Spektral Quartet** opens. Widely regarded as one of the city’s most magnetic and forward-thinking chamber ensembles, their 2013/14 season saw the critically-acclaimed release of the group’s debut album, *Chambers*, with two more recordings set to launch in the new year on Azica Records and Warner Classics. For this concert the quartet presents Steve Reich’s modern masterpiece *Different Trains*.
