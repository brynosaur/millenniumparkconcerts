**[San Fermin](http://sanferminband.com "San Fermin")** is the brainchild of Brooklyn’s Ellis Ludwig-Leone, an artist with a broad musical background who pursued musical studies at Yale and sharpened his teeth working with the avant-garde classical composer Nico Muhly (Björk, Grizzly Bear, Antony & the Johnsons).

Brooklyn-based ensemble **[Sō Percussion](http://sopercussion.com "Sō Percussion")** is a quartet of percussionists who play contemporary classical works as well as a mixture of music from other genres. Since 1999, Sō Percussion has been creating music that explores all the extremes of emotion and musical possibility.
