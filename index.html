  <h3>What's this about?</h3>

  <p><b>I am in no way associated with Millinnium Park or the City of Chicago.</b></p>

  <p>This is an unofficial, mobile-friendly guide to Millennium Park's wonderful summer concert series. I'm simply a music lover, an enthusiastic attendee, and a Chicagoan.</p>

  <p>Every year, I find myself slogging through the City of Chicago's website to find out which artists are performing on which dates. So, this year I decided to make that information easier to find. Hopefully it proves useful to you as well. I'll do my best to keep everything up to date throughout the summer.</p>
