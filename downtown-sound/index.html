      <p><b>Robbie Fulks</b>, Chicago's prodigiously talented singer, songwriter, and guitarist, has the soul of a country singer and the mind of a vaudevillian. Lost in the deserved accolades for being a fabulously unique, clever, and heartfelt writer is the fact that he's also one of the best guitarists around.</p>

      <p>Steve Dawson, leader of Chicago folk-rock group Dolly Varden, has joined forces with some of the city's most revered improvising musicians to form a new band called <b>Funeral Bonsai Wedding</b>.</p>

    <section class="bio">

      <p>Hailing from Syria, <b>Omar Souleyman</b> not only changed the vibe of weddings throughout the Middle East with his Shaabi street sound, but also brought it to the West through his notorious late night festival slots. His latest release, <i>Wenu Wenu</i>, was produced by Kieran Hebden (Four Tet).</p>

      <p><b>Natural Information Society</b> is the genre-defying project of Chicago bassist Joshua Abrams. In performance the music revolves around the sound of the guimbri (a Gnawan lute), integrating composition and improvisation to create hypnotic, highly rhythmic, sustained psychedelic environments.</p>

    </header>

    <section class="bio">

    <p>Named by Rolling Stone Magazine as one of the Top 20 Guitarists of All Time, <b>Richard Thompson</b> is also one of the world's most critically acclaimed and prolific songwriters. Having co-founded the groundbreaking group Fairport Convention as a teenager in the 60's, Richard Thompson and his mates virtually invented British Folk Rock. By the age of 21 he left the band to pursue his own career, followed by a decade long musical partnership with his then-wife Linda, to over 30 years as a highly successful solo artist.</p>

    <p>His last album <i>Electric</i>, was produced by studio extraordinaire Buddy Miller, and released by New West records in February of 2013. For his Millennium Park debut Mr. Thompson will play a solo acoustic set followed by a full electric set with his trio.</p>

    </header>

    <section class="bio">

    <p><b>Bob Mould</b>'s journey as singer-songwriter, guitarist, author, DJ, and all-around MVP began in 1979 with the formation of Hüsker Dü. In 1988, Mould began the first part of his solo career with the albums <i>Workbook</i> and <i>Black Sheets of Rain</i>. In 1992, Bob gave the world Sugar, a reimagined power trio. Now well into his fourth decade as a singer-songwriter, Mould is as relevant, ferocious, and poignant as he has ever. The new album <i>Beauty & Ruin</i> may very well be the most epic emotional roller coaster ever pressed into 36 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Split Single</b> is the new project from Jason Narducy. Jason recorded the album, <i>Fragmented World</i> with Spoon's Britt Daniel, and Superchunk / Mountain Goats drummer Jon Wurster to craft a plush collection of rock songs. He will be performing these songs with Chicago musicians Tim Remis and Jake Smith.</p>

    </header>

    <section class="bio">

    <p><b>Joe Pug</b> is a songwriter from Austin, TX, by way of Chicago. With a modern take on the folk tradition and a work ethic that reflects his years as a carpenter, Pug's ascension to the national spotlight challenged the traditional rulebook of the industry, enlisting fans directly to spread the gospel of his songs which balance sharp narrative, social criticism and passionate delivery.</p>

    <p><b>Hurray For The Riff Raff</b> is New Orleans-based songwriter Alynda Lee Segarra, but in many ways it's much more than that: it's a young woman leaving her indelible stamp on the American folk tradition.</p>

    <section class="bio">

    <p><b>Maps & Atlases</b> are a Chicago rock band who defy easy categorization. Their experimental and traditional song-forms collide with hymnal harmonies, percolating rhythms, and maximalist creativity, resulting in boundary-busting, asymmetrical pop.</p>

    <p><b>Wooden Shjips</b>, recording on Chicago's Thrill Jockey label, transform heavy psychedelic rock into minimalist masterpieces.</p>
