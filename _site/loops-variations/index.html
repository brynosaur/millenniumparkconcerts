    <h3>YACHT</h3>
    <h4>Hauschka with Q Ensemble</h4>
  </header>

  <p>LA-based conceptual pop group <b>YACHT</b> has played on boats, in caves, in bathrooms, and in art galleries, not to mention tours with LCD Soundsystem, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Hot Chip, Architecture in Helsinki, Vampire Weekend, The Dirty Projectors, the Breeders, and Phoenix. Their live set, named “Temporary Autonomous Zones”, features uncluttered, anarchic, inspiring sessions of damaged dance moves and coded ritualism, backed by constantly changing elements—Power Point presentations, audience Q&A sessions, and shamanistic video environments.</p>

  <p>Prepared piano innovator Hauschka will open the show displaying his modern methods of creating unsuspected electronic sounding tones from the instrument. He will be supporting his latest album release <i>Abandoned City</i> and will be joined on stage by renowned local Chicago all-female string players, <b>Q Ensemble</b>.</p>

    <h4>Ghost Beach</h4>
  </header>

  <p>Hailed by The New Yorker as “vibrant” and “superb,” Chicago-based <b>Third Coast Percussion</b> has gained national attention with concerts and recordings that meld the energy of rock music with the precision and nuance of classical chamber works.

The piece was recently hailed by the <i>Chicago Classical Review</i> as "one of the most powerful new music experiences I've felt in years." The program will also feature Marc Mellits's rapturous new work, <i>Gravity</i>, and works by TCP-member David Skidmore and former TCP-member Owen Clayton Condon.</p>

    <h3>Oneohtrix Point Never, Featuring Video Artist Nate Boyce</h3>
    <h4>Spektral Quartet</h4>
  </header>

  <p>Acclaimed electronic music composer Daniel Lopatin, who records and performs under the moniker <b>Oneohtrix Point Never</b>, has always deftly balanced the experimental with the accessible. On his latest Warp Records release, <i>Commissions I</i>, the artist outlays his commissioned music for artwork, performance and film from years past. This music will be on full display when video artist <b>Nate Boyce</b> joins the lineup. Boyce, like Lopatin and his live soundscapes, creates improvised visuals and CGI forms, mutating and morphing found-text in disorientating virtual space. No strangers to the art museum circuit the duo have toured together extensively, performing at venues including MoMA/PS1, the Walker Art Center, and Wexner Center for the Arts.</p>

  <p>Ensemble-in-residence at the University of Chicago, <b>Spektral Quartet</b> opens. Widely regarded as one of the city’s most magnetic and forward-thinking chamber ensembles, their 2013/14 season saw the critically-acclaimed release of the group’s debut album, <i>Chambers</i>, with two more recordings set to launch in the new year on Azica Records and Warner Classics. For this concert the quartet presents Steve Reich’s modern masterpiece <i>Different Trains</i>.</p>

    <h4>Dream Koala</h4>
  </header>

  <p><b>Alarm Will Sound</b>'s Chicago debut features the music of Aphex Twin, Steve Reich, Tyondai Braxton and John Orfe. The large ensemble has been described as "the SEAL Team Six of new music" by <i>New York Magazine</i> and as "one of the most vital ensembles on the American music scene" by the <i>New York Times</i>. In this show, Alarm Will Sound transforms the electronica of Aphex Twin into live performance on acoustic instruments, putting machine-made music into the hands of human players. Steve Reich's newest work <i>Radio Rewrite</i>, based on the music of Radiohead, and Tyondai Braxton's <i>Fly By Wire</i>, both written specifically for Alarm Will Sound's adventurous virtuosos, explore the relationship between popular and classical music.</p>

  <p>Brazilian-rooted and Paris-based phenom <b>Dream Koala</b> opens, inviting audiences into a surreal and subconscious musical world.</p>
